                <h2>About Me</h2>

                <p>My name is Angella Nasha Renggi Anak Charlton Chundi, born and raised in the serene town of Kapit, Sarawak. Embraced by the rich cultural tapestry of the Iban community, my upbringing has been steeped in tradition and a strong sense of identity. As the eldest daughter in my family, I hold the privilege and responsibility of setting an example for my younger brother and sister, guiding them with the wisdom passed down through generations. My Christian faith is a cornerstone of my life, providing a moral compass and a source of comfort and strength. Together, my heritage and faith form the bedrock of my character, driving me to approach life with diligence, compassion, and integrity.</p>


                <p>With a solid academic foundation in business studies evidenced by exceptional SPM results and a diploma with a CGPA of 3.49, I am now advancing my expertise in finance through my Bachelor's degree. My educational journey is complemented by my active involvement in course-related clubs, having served as an executive committee member for D'BES and currently excelling in a similar role with BAFIN, the finance students' club.</p>
                <p>I aim to forge a career in the business and finance sector, leveraging my analytical skills and financial knowledge to contribute effectively to an organization's success. I have honed my leadership abilities and teamwork skills, preparing me for the collaborative and dynamic nature of the finance industry. I am keen to apply my learned principles in a practical setting, aspiring to be part of a team where I can further refine my competencies and support business growth.</p>
